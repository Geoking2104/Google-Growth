# Google Growth

Agent skill for live **GA4**, **GTM**, **Search Console**, **PageSpeed**, and **CrUX**.

It teaches the agent how to brief, audit, and prioritize. It does **not** include credentials or the MCP server.

## What you get

- Weekly analytics briefings from real API data
- Detailed cross-channel dashboards with period-over-period KPIs, 10+ evidence-backed watch points, and a 3-horizon action plan
- SEO and performance priority tables (Search Console + CrUX + PageSpeed)
- GTM and server-side tracking audits
- Gated writes only (sitemap, Indexing API, GTM tags)

## Prerequisite

Connect the open-source MCP server: https://github.com/Geoking2104/Google-Growth

Without that connection the skill explains setup and refuses to invent numbers.

## Install

Unzip so `SKILL.md` sits at the root of `google-growth/`:
