# ga-to-grok skill

Expert workflows for **Google Analytics 4**, **Google Tag Manager** (web + server-side), and **Measurement Protocol** via the open-source [Google Growth MCP server](https://github.com/Geoking2104/Google-Growth).

## What this skill does

It teaches an AI agent how to:

- Discover and call the correct MCP tools
- Sequence analytics briefings, GTM audits, ecommerce validation, and sGTM dual-tagging / cutover
- Stay safe on writes (dry-run first, never publish, never expose secrets)

## Prerequisites

This skill **does not** contain credentials or the MCP server itself.

You must:

1. Deploy or run the [Google Growth MCP server](https://github.com/Geoking2104/Google-Growth) (Docker, Fly, Railway, VPS, or local).
2. Authenticate it with a Google Service Account that has access to your GA4 property (and GTM accounts if needed).
3. Connect the server to your agent (Custom Connector with HTTPS `/mcp` or `/sse`, or local stdio).

Until the MCP tools appear in the agent, the skill can only give setup instructions — it cannot return live data.
